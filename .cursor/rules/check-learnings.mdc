# Check Learnings Before Planning

Before creating a plan or starting non-trivial work, search `.cursor/docs/ai-learnings/`
for related prior decisions, anti-patterns, and counter-intuitive findings.

```
rg -l "<keyword>" .cursor/docs/ai-learnings/
```

Use module names, tags, or topic keywords relevant to the task. Read any matching
files and incorporate their decisions and anti-patterns into your approach.

Skip this step only for single-file, obvious changes (typo fixes, comment edits, etc.).
